Welcome to this Microsoft solutions workshop on *Azure SQL*.  

In this one day, hands-on, scenario-driven workshop, you'll learn how to translate your existing SQL Server expertise to Azure SQL including Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instance. At the end of the day, you should have a foundational knowledge of what to use when, as well as how to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot the “meat and potatoes” of SQL Server in Azure: security, performance, and availability. You will learn about not only the “what”, but also the “how” and the “why”. You’ll also walk away with resources and tools so you can go as deep as your scenario requires.  

This README.MD file explains how the workshop is laid out, what you will learn, and the technologies you will use in this solution.

After this workshop, you should be able to:
<br>

- Determine which Azure SQL deployment option (virtual machines, single databases, serverless databases, elastic pools of databases, hyperscale databases, and managed instances) and service tier should be used for scenarios that meet the needs of your application.
- Deploy, configure, monitor, and troubleshoot security, performance, and availability scenarios in Azure SQL using both familiar and new tools and techniques.
- Harness the “power of the cloud” including automation and intelligent capabilities of Azure SQL.
-	Translate your existing SQL Server expertise to Azure SQL expertise.


The goal of this workshop is to train experienced SQL Server professionals.

Many organizations are faced with an aging or under-engineered data platform strategy. There's been a big trend of moving existing systems to the cloud, building new applications quickly with the cloud, and off-loading some of the on-premises costs. You need a plan for how to move some workloads to the cloud, and you need to understand how to set your organization up for success. You also need to understand how the role of a DBA or Data professional stays the same, and what changes you'll have to make. This workshop will prepare you to be successful in Azure.

The solution includes the following technologies - although you are not limited to these, they form the basis of the workshop. At the end of the workshop you will learn how to extrapolate these components into other solutions. You will also be provided with references to much deeper training provided.

You'll need a local system that you are able to install software on. The workshop demonstrations use Microsoft Windows as an operating system and all examples use Windows for the workshop. Optionally, you can use a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to install the software on and work with the solution.

You must have a Microsoft Azure account with the ability to create assets.

This workshop expects that you understand and are experienced in working with, maintaining, and developing with SQL Server. Having some familiarity with the general structure of Azure will be helpful, but not required, before attending the workshop.

These instructions should be completed before the workshop starts, since you will not have time to cover these in class. <i>Remember to turn off any Virtual Machines from the Azure Portal when not taking the class so that you do incur charges (shutting down the machine in the VM itself is not sufficient)</i>.

This includes Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL managed instance. Understanding what Platform as a Service (PaaS) encompasses and how it compares to the SQL Server “box” will help level-set what you get (and don’t get) when you move to the cloud.   </td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqlworkshop/blob/master/azuresqlworkshop/02-DeployAndConfigure.md" target="_blank">02 - Deploy and Configure</a></td><td>We’ll cover deployment, configuration, and other getting started related tasks for Azure SQL. You'll learn how you should plan for deployment, deploy, and verify your deployment, and how it compares to SQL Server. Then, you'll learn how deploying and configuring databases compares, plus some insights on loading data.   </td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: AliceBlue; color: black;"><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqlworkshop/blob/master/azuresqlworkshop/03-Security.md" target="_blank">03 - Security</a> </td><td td style="background-color: AliceBlue; color: black;">Ensuring security and compliance of your data is always a top priority. You’ll learn how to use Azure SQL to secure your data, how to configure logins and users, how to use tools and techniques for monitoring security, how to ensure your data meets industry and regulatory compliance standards, and how to leverage the extra benefits and intelligence that is only available in Azure. We’ll also cover some of the networking considerations for securing SQL.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqlworkshop/blob/master/azuresqlworkshop/04-Performance.md" target="_blank">04 - Performance</a></td><td>You’ve been responsible for getting your SQL fast, keeping it fast, and making it fast again when something is wrong. We’ll show you how to leverage your existing performance skills, processes, and tools and apply them to Azure SQL, including taking advantage of the intelligence in Azure to keep your database tuned.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: AliceBlue; color: black;"><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops-azuresqlworkshop/blob/master/azuresqlworkshop/05-Availability.md" target="_blank">05 - Availability</a> </td><td td style="background-color: AliceBlue; color: black;">Depending on the SLA your business requires, Azure SQL has the options you need including built-in capabilities.
